        <h2>Summer Streets</h2>
        <p>Summer Streets is an annual celebration of New York City's most valuable public space, our streets. Summer Streets provides space for healthy recreation and encourages New Yorkers to use more sustainable forms of transportation. In 2013, more than 300,000 people took advantage of the open streets.
Volunteering is a great way to have a great time while helping thousands of your neighbors navigate Summer Streets.
Volunteers are needed for all three Summer Streets Saturdays to assist with marshalling the route, directing participants and help thousands of New Yorkers enjoy Summer Streets, and you'll have a great time too! Please make sure to complete all of the fields below so that we can get back in touch with you quickly.
If you are under the age of 18 or would like to register a group, please email the Summer Streets team.</p>

        <h2>Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen</h2>
        <p>Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen, in addition to our food program, has our committed staff and volunteers work with guests to ensure they are receiving full benefits, connect them to additional supportive services, help with job applications and even reunite them with family members.
Every day at 10:30 a.m. sharp, hundreds of hungry and homeless New Yorkers walk through the doors of Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen to get a warm nutritious meal and seek help in finding their way on to a better way of life.
But 45 minutes beforehand, another crowd is gathering: 50-60 volunteers who will make sure that happens.
From greeting guests to serving food, cleaning tables to passing out haircut vouchers, it is our volunteers who enable us to be here for our guests every day.
One of the most important things we do is to treat our guests with dignity and respect, and as a volunteer this is part of your job too.
A warm smile or some friendly conversation can really help brighten our guests' days - and as a volunteer you might be surprised at how much this experience will brighten yours as well!
You can sign up to volunteer any weekday. You'll need to be available from 9:45 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. Many volunteers stay for lunch afterwards and, just like our guests, enjoy the community to be found here.</p>

Volunteers over the age of 21 will be matched with children between the ages of 7-17 living in all five boroughs. Currently, there's a high demand for male volunteers to be matched with boys on the waitlist, and willingness to travel to the outer boroughs is a plus.</p>

    <h2>Volunteer with Reading Partners - Make a Lifelong Impact on a Child!</h2>
    <p>Reading Partners is a local nonprofit organization that works to expand life opportunities for elementary school children in low income communities by empowering them with strong literacy skills. We recruit and train community volunteers to work one-on-on with students.

We are recruiting for the 2018-2019 school year for our program! Unfortunately, we do not have summer programming.

We work in four of the five boroughs, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan!

With just 1-2 hours a week, you can make a huge difference in the lives of children who have fallen behind in reading and are at risk of falling further. One-on-one instruction at the student's reading level provides the opportunity for individualized academic attention and a healthy learning relationship with you, the volunteer. Volunteers are, in turn, supported at all times by Reading Partners school site coordinators and staff.

For more information, go to readingpartners.org and submit our volunteer form online or send an email to volunteerNY@readingpartners.org.

Requirements: No previous experience necessary. All ages 14+ can tutor: Being a volunteer with Reading Partners is a great opportunity for high school students, college students, working professionals, full-time parents, and retirees. People of all ages and backgrounds can be a valuable resource for young people learning to read.</p>

Our services are available to anyone 60 years and older who is mentally sound, emotionally stable, and able to interact with others. We serve seniors in lower Manhattan, south of 30th Street, from the East River to the Hudson. Our Friendly Visiting program also serves seniors living in the Forest Hills/Rego Park community of Queens.

Whether you can make a commitment of a few hours every week, or just help out occasionally, there are many ways for you to become involved with the elderly community. You can volunteer weekly and be matched with one senior, or if you'd prefer, you can be designated as "on call." We welcome volunteers of all ages and backgrounds. We do not discriminate on the basis of age, gender, race, religion, sexual preference, or lifestyle. If you would like to help seniors as they face the challenges of aging alone in New York City, we will find a way for you to volunteer.

We can always use extra help with special events.</p>
